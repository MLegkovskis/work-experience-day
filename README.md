# Alexa Marketing Playground

A simple starter project for work experience day.

## What this repo does
- Keeps all UI in a single `index.html` file.
- Deploys automatically to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions on every push to `main`.

## Why everything is in one file
For this workshop, it is easier if all code lives in `index.html`:
- HTML in the page body (`<body>`) for content and structure
- CSS in a `<style>` block for colors and layout
- JavaScript in a `<script>` block for interactions (like button clicks)

This keeps the first coding experience simple.

For bigger apps, teams usually split files:
- `index.html` for structure
- `styles.css` for styling
- `script.js` for logic

## How students use it
1. Open `index.html`.
2. Ask Copilot to make a small visual/content change.
3. Commit and push to `main`.
4. GitHub Actions deploys the updated page to GitHub Pages.

## One-time repo setting
In GitHub repo settings, set **Pages** source to **GitHub Actions**.

## Quick basics: HTML, browser, JavaScript
- HTML: The page structure. It defines things like headings, paragraphs, buttons, and images.
- Browser: The app (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) that reads your HTML/CSS/JS and shows the website.
- JavaScript: The programming language running in the browser that makes pages interactive.
